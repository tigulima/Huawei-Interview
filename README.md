# HuaweiPythonTest

Hello! Recently I was selected, through a job interview, to be developing a few simple webscraping aplications in pyhton and I realised there is not much content on the internet to help us out on this market, so I had to bang my head on the wall for two days straight to get around some little and inofensive (that's what I thought) syntax error. Now there's no reason for me to keep this knowloge for my self. I Hope you'll enjoy it :)

This project is separated in three main archives: ex01.py, ex02.py and ex03.py. Each one made to answare one of the tree tasks passed over for me.

Those were the questions:

The following questions that require coding should be answered in Python.

  1. Schematize an OO application that receives user authentication information (username and password), access a webpage using the information given, retrieve data from the webpage (HTML table), and export the extracted data (excel file). The schematic should consider class variables and methods, including parameters and outputs.

  2. Develop a script that can access a given URL and return all email addresses found in the page. These pages can be used as examples:
   
     i. https://www.golfclubsatthetribute.com/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&pageid=149&ssid=204&vnf=1;

     ii. https://www.thegolfclubatfossilcreek.com/club-contacts;

     iii. https://www.mg-cc.org/club-information/club-contacts;

  3. Develop a script that can list all the content inside a directory and returns a dataframe with the following information:

      a. Name;
    
      b. Extension;
    
      c. Location;
    
      d. Size;
    
      e. Last modification date.
    
To complete the tasks, I used the following libs:
  - Selenium

        pip install selenium
    
  - BeatufulSoup4

        pip install BeautifulSoup4
  
  - Requests

        pip install requests
        
  - Pandas

        pip install pandas
  
  - Chrome drivers 
 
        https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads
